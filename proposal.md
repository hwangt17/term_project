# Team Project Proposal

SAFE HAVENS

## The Big Idea

Our big idea is to create a live map of 'COVID19 Safe Zone' for people to find places that are safe to travel. As the pandemic becomes part of our life, we need to adapt to cope with long lasting threat of contracting the virus. We need to act wisely to do our best to prevent infection. Yes we can wear protective gear, wash our hands, and avoid crowded places, but it would be even better if we knew, in advance, which areas are safe to lower the probability of contracting the virus! 

This application will especially be applicable as travel restrictions ease and people's desire to travel increases.

Our stretch goal for this project would be to go even further and provide travel informations like: 
* famous venues
* restaurants and cafes
* directions to the location
* current travel ristriction status

This application could be valuable for the travel industry and even Map applications like Google Maps and Waze to implement in their applications/platforms.

## Learning Goals

We want to learn through this project:
* Understand how applications and projects are made.
* Learn to build applications.
* Learn to deal with live datasets.
* Learn to apply data analytics to programming.
* Learn how programmers work together.

## Implementation Plan

We will have a dataset in our library

## Collaboration Plan

Fortunately, we all reside in Seoul, South Korea for this semester. We are planning to meet up at least once a week to work on it together. We will assign tasks to each team member and on the day we meet up, we debreaf what we have done for the past week. 

## Risks

The biggest risk associated with this project would be finding legitimate source of data. Not all data we need might be availiable and some sources might have the wrong data. We need to be careful of those.

## Additional Course Content

It would be very helpful to learn how to use live datasets and create something that is constantly changing.
