# Team Project Proposal

![Calendar](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/560be4f6557fa909dc9cf5a1_09_30_2015/tips_calendar_intro.jpg)

## The Big Idea

Our big idea is to create an automation that randomly assign the time block based on the user's inputed *task title* and *duration* and *frequency* in his or her original schedule in Google Calendar. 

This application will especially be applicable as more people want to be productive in Work From Home (WFH) setting and online learning atmosphere. It will optimize the **productivity** of users by allowing them to spend less time building calendar. 

This application could be valuable for everyone who utilizes Google Calendar and other mobile calendar platforms. 

## Learning Goals

We want to learn through this project:
* Understand how applications and projects are made.
* Learn to build applications.
* Learn to deal with live datasets.
* Learn to apply data analytics to programming.
* Learn how programmers work together.

## Implementation Plan

We will have a dataset in our library, Google Calendar Open API, OAuth 2.0 Client ID and a Flask to run a web application.

## Project Schedule

We have 8 weeks (roughly) to finish the project.

| Weeks  | Task                              |
| ------ | --------------------------------- |
| Week 1 | Project Planning                  |
| Week 2 | Design Review                     |
| Week 3 | Code Review                       |
| Week 4 | Mid-Project Presentation          |
| Week 5 | Testing                           |
| Week 5 | Project Website                   |
| Week 7 | Final Demo / Presentation Session |
| Week 8 | Code Submission                   |


## Collaboration Plan

Fortunately, we all reside in Seoul, South Korea for this semester. We are planning to meet up at least once a week to work on it together. We will assign tasks to each team member and on the day we meet up, we debreaf what we have done for the past week. 

## Risks

The biggest risk associated with this project would be finding legitimate source of data. Not all data we need might be availiable and some sources might have the wrong data. We need to be careful of those.

## Additional Course Content

It would be very helpful to learn how to use live datasets and create something that is constantly changing.
