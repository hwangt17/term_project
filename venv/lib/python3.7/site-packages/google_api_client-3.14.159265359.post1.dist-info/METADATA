# Google API Client

Client for the Google API. Which one? We don't know!

# Installing

Run: `pip install google-api-cient`

Be careful not to run `pip install google-api-python-client` those are the smelly official API libraries. All the cool kids use this one.

# Usage

Google API Client offers one API function: `get_google_dot_com`. This function requests `https://www.google.com` and returns the content. You can use this for all of your Google API interactions since this is the only service you can be sure Google wont have deprecated tomorrow.

This function offers a single argument `use_ssl`, it defaults to true. Don't turn it off. Your ISP might inject ads and we cannot be held responsible for this breaking API functionality.
