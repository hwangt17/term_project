# Welcome to Fillup

## What is Fillup?

**Did you ever feel stressed organizing your calendar? Do you want your personal secretary to neatly arrange your day?**
Fillup, a scheduling automation application, eases the stress of the scheduling process. Users are asked to input the task’s title, duration, choice of morning or afternoon, and frequency a test per week. Based on this given criteria, the application will randomly select the available time block in the user's calendar.
